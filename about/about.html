      <h1><strong>About me</strong></h1>
    </div>
    <p1>Hi there my name is Markian currently studying web designing at moringa school.
      since i started the programme a week ago it has been an overwhelming experience.Going into the programme i obviously knew it was a "boot camp" kind of situation
      but i didnt expect this ,not having any background experience in coding also made the process my harder.While writing this i would say am much better at html and css.</p1>
    <p2>I think the main reason for me taking up this course was to challenge myself.I want to see what i can do when in a short time with alot of content to consume.Maybe ther might be alot of influence from shows about hacking big coperation like
      the famous whistle blower <strong>Edward Snowden</strong>
      </strong>.And maybe the fact that i have just finished high school and alot of time to at hand.</p2>
    <p3>I currently intrested in alot of thing.What am mostly intrested in is tech,mostly latest phone and laptops.Learning why one phone will cost 1000$ while cost 10$.I learn this through youtube watching famous tech youtubers such as mkbhd,linus
      tech tips,unbox therapy and many more.

      Am also intrested in listening to podcasts about great people giving advice to the world about their success,the greatest of all time being <strong>Steve Jobs</strong>
      with the famous quote which humbles me everyday<strong>"stay foolish and stay hungry"</strong>.
      I also find myself being intrested in bodybuilding,Hoping one day maybe to compete and win the mr olympia title.
      My greatest motivation comes from the champion of all time Arnold Schwarzenegger.
